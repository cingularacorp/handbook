# Finance
This is the Finance area of the Cingulara Handbook.

## Fiscal Responsibility
Cingulara was bootstrapped with our own personal money to start this company and a contract vehicle to jump to quickly. As we move forward, we will maintain an idea to be as debt free as possible. The only reason to take on debt would be for growth opportunities as we move in our corporate infancy going forward until we can sustain new contracts and groups of hires financially ourselves. Whenever you hire someone, they expect to be paid in roughly two weeks. However, with contracts being what they are we usually bill at the end of the month with a net-45 or net-60 payment schedule. So it could be up to three months of a person working here before any money is paid to Cingulara for their work. And that is per person.

## Board Meetings
Board Meetings happen at least twice a year and on an as-needed basis where appropriate.

## Financial Issues
Any financial issues on payments at a company level should be directed to ceo@cingulara.com for quick response.

## Charities
Currently we do not donate to any charities. If you have one in mind that matches with our corporate goals and ideals please put into the Slack channel.

## Sponsorship
Currently we do not sponsor anyone. However, in the near future we will be doing a corporate sponsorship of OpenFaaS and its maintainer Alex Ellis.
