# Company
This is the Company area of the Cingulara Handbook.

## History
Cingulara was started in January of 2019 with a single subcontract to KBR out of Patuxent River, MD. The idea of Cingulara started 2 1/2 years earlier in a room in the Owings library among friends and future business partners. From that late summer/early fall meeting until January 2019 the idea grew and grew until we had a viable way to 1) start the company with funding and 2) have a contract to start working in the software development area using new technologies.

Our first contract started in May of 2019 and we have been going forward ever since. We have business development ideas and partnerships across commercial and federal government sectors and are pursuing those constantly. We also have a few product ideas to leverage on growing the company. The initial example is OpenRMF -- a tool that started in July of 2018 on the CTO's vacation.

## Culture
*You are who you hire*

At Cingulara our culture depends on who we hire. And we hire those people with a drive to Get Sh*t Done! We are unapologetic about that. We want people driven to succeed. That is an attitude or a personal trait more than a skill of technology or a software programming language. Skills can be taught. How a person is was formed well before we talked to them about working with our company. We hire people and we get them to the skill level we need and they aspire to. 

That said, our culture has a few things to start with as we continue to grow and mature:
* Hard working
* Ability to Fail
* Continuous Learning
* Accepting of different ideas, cultures, religions, and backgrounds

That last one is an important one here. We may not always agree across all employees and owners; however, we can respect that people have differing opinions. And we believe different beliefs and experiences helps shape a much more well-rounded group, team, and company to accomplish things in today's business environment.

## Vision

Hyper Automation. That is our vision. To automate as much as possible, leaving what is left to those that must insert their values, experience, expertise, and intelligence for value-added steps toward a common end goal. *It takes hard work to be lazy* is what we say. Not that we like being lazy. We just do not like to do manual steps that should be automated. 

## Strategy

Our current strategy is to leverage partnerships and relationships with companies such as KBR to expand into the federal government realm. Our current capabilities of software engineering, prototyping and specifically using containers, microservices, APIs, and messaging/distributed systems to create solutions is expanding with our partnerships with federal contracting companies. In addition, the OpenRMF tool is being leveraged to open doors with partnerships and subcontract agreements in the area of cybersecurity and compliance for DISA STIGs and NIST guidelines for software and systems.

Commercially we are working with the Reaching for the Stars group and in particular Cerebral Palsy TV (CPTV) on TV platforms and web platforms for education, videos, and events across the spectrum for those dealing with Cerebral Palsy.

## Areas of Concentration
* Federal Contracting with regard to modern software engineering
* Agile techniques to accomplish this
* DevSecOps and automation of software development life cycle steps
* Containerization and Microservices where appropriate
* Modernization / Migration of older applications to newer modern techniques
