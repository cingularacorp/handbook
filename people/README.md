# People
This is the People area of the Cingulara Handbook.

## Hiring
We hire people based on need and fit to the company, the culture, and the attitude of the person. Skills need to be present however skills or "finding a person to fit the skill regardless of the person" is **NOT** what we do here. We have to have a place for people to hire them. We do hire to the fit and attitude of the person and work with them to get all skills to where they need to be at a minimum.

## Benefits
The current list of benefits is below. This list will grow. If you have suggestions put in a PR!

## Diversity
Diversity in this IT industry we are in is essential. This industry is dominated currently by males who are predominantly white (circa 2019). To diversify, Cingulara actively looks to include all groups regardless of race, background, religious beliefs, political affiliations as well as conscious or unconscious biases. We are also actively looking at and encouraging programs such as Girls Who Code to further this cause. We are currently working to break down our own unconscious biases in the hiring process to find people that are good, solid, hard working people that fit our culture and have some skills that are close enough. As said elsewhere, we hire to personal fit and can help train those willing to work hard and learn. 

This is not just a tag line marketing term. We are working to improve ourselves in this area, and in turn our IT industry. 

## Continuous Learning
Continually learning is a requirement for those in the IT industry. Whether it is software engineering processes, QA techniques, cloud technologies, serverless frameworks, cybersecurity processes, or new languages and practices the world of IT is constantly moving forward, evolving, or revolutionizing things. At Cingulara we work to give all employees the benefit of tools and learning resources for this very thing. It is up to you to do it and use it! Whether it is a private VPC area for you on AWS, use of the A Cloud Guru platform for learning new tools, going to a conference or tech talk, or going to/hosting a meetup Cingulara is working to set you up for success. And we expect all employees, senior management, as well as board members to do the same.

## Dress Code
If you are a remote worker, and the goal is to hire for this first and foremost, your dress code consists of three things at a minimum:
1. underclothes
2. shorts
3. shirt

That is a minimum. If you want to wear a long sleeve or short sleeve, go for it. If you want to wear long pants and socks, go for it. This is the bare minimum set well before the company started. 

That said, if you have to be onsite or you like working onsite in an office-type environment, then the office or customer realistically dictates the dress code. This could consist of business casual, jeans and t-shirt, or suit and tie. This discussion happens when you are talking about a specific position or opportunity.

## Self Development
Continuous improvement and learning is important at Cingulara. If you are here, you are the kind of person that likes to learn new things. The other part of self development is staying healthy. *No use getting wealthy if you are not healthy enough to enjoy it!* Getting out of the office, out from the desk, and exercising in some kind of way is the other part of this. We do not have a gym membership or wellness membership benefit as of yet, but we are working toward that. Do yourself and your family a favor and get into some healthy habits.
