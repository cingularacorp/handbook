# Open Source
This is the Open Source area of the Cingulara Handbook. Most businesses and software development shops in particular lean on open source software to use and to gain speed. However, most of the time we do not give back. Cingulara is looking to change this with our own open source software but also sponsorship of those who are doing the same.

## OpenRMF
OpenRMF is our tool to manage the RMF process and data as it pertains to our federal customers. The Risk Management Framework and all the STIG documentation is a beast to manage. And many, many people even as of 2019 are doing this *MANUALLY* of all things! Reporting manually. Checking compliance manually. And that has to stop. So we have a tool OpenRMF in various repos here https://github.com/Cingulara?tab=repositories to help combat that.

The story of OpenRMF is up on our company website so it does not have to be repeated here. And the open source version is really sized for a team. The current version 0.8 is due out soon and has login/pwd and RBAC included with the web, APIs, and messaging architecture of the tool built in. 

## OpenFaaS
OpenFaaS is available at https://github.com/openfaas/faas and is an open source tool that is for Functions as a Service. Think AWS lambda but not tied to any particular cloud provider. This is *NOT* our application however it is run and supported by Alex Ellis who is a great example of how to run and market a great open source tool that many people use. So we are including it here as a reference and to show what it does. He does ask for support via GitHub and we will be doing this shortly as a corporation.
