# Marketing
This is the Marketing area of the Cingulara Handbook.

## Website
Our website is at https://www.cingulara.com/. If you want to know how it was done and automated using AWS, CodeShip, GitHub and Slack see the blog posts 
https://medium.com/@dale.bingham_30375/creating-a-static-website-using-godaddy-github-aws-s3-codedeploy-and-aws-cloudfront-1990a8f4ddd8 and https://medium.com/@dale.bingham_30375/automating-your-static-website-updates-using-github-codeship-slack-and-aws-lambda-40643ccd659b. 

## Twitter
Our twitter handle is [@cingulara](https://twitter.com/cingulara) on Twitter.

## Blogs
Our current CTO Dale Bingham has our only blog posts currently at https://medium.com/@dale.bingham_30375.

## Products
Currently our only product is OpenRMF. And that is under the Open Source area of the handbook. As we get more products they will show up here.

## Corporate
Our current corporate marketing is via our website and Twitter. If you wish to have business cards to help market yourself and our company see your manager or email info@cingulara.com. Or post something in the general area of Slack for our company to get some information.

## Trade Shows
We currently do not sponsor any trade shows, however the KubeCon North America conference and the AWS re:Invent conference are two excellent ones! If you wish to go to one of those (just one for now!) then see your manager, ask in the events channel of Slack, or email cto@cingulara.com for more information.

If you want to answer a CWP (call for white papers, CFP, etc.) then let our CTO know and he can help get that going for you!
