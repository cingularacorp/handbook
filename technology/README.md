# Technology
This is the Technology area of the Cingulara Handbook.

## Email, Online Docs, Video Conferencing
Cingulara is using the Google Suite of tools for email, documents, spreadsheets, presentations and video conferencing (Hangouts Meet). When you are an employee here you will have access to that with a first.last@cingulara.com email and login. You also will find shared drives to use depending on your role and project within the company on Google Drive. 

## Slack
Cingulara has a Slack channel you will get invited to once you join the company and its people. There are many channels to cover technology, personal skills, general announcements, etc. as well as team and project level channels. And people have the rights to add a channel where it makes sense. There is a code of conduct on using the channels and that is monitored. Just keep that in mind.

## Timesheet
If on a federal project, you are required to enter your time into a timesheet daily. Currently, we are using MS Excel to track time. In the near future we will use an online system that is DCAA approved to track time and help to generate invoices. 

## Projects

We currently have a software development project using Golang, microservices, messaging, CesiumJS and other technology for a federal customer. 

OpenRMF is also a project we are currently funding internally. 

## AWS

We have a corporate AWS account that can be leveraged and used for internal project, external project, hosting, as well as testing out ideas. Our AWS is meant to be kept secure so you do not have free reign. You have guardrails to keep you out of trouble though!

Our current https://www.cingulara.com/ website is hosted using a CDN on AWS using static HTML. We even have our CTO's blog post on that! https://medium.com/@dale.bingham_30375/creating-a-static-website-using-godaddy-github-aws-s3-codedeploy-and-aws-cloudfront-1990a8f4ddd8
